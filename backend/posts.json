He is a third-year student at Kyoto Jujutsu High School and a grade 1 jujutsu sorcerer. He was mentored by Yuki Tsukumo in his youth and considers Yuji Itadori his best friend.\nAoi Todo is a tall young man who stands about the same height as Satoru Gojo[3]. He has a very defined, heavy muscular build and relatively tan skin. He has small black eyes and shoulder-length black hair that is almost always tied into a top-knot bun with unusual flyaway strands with rounded ends akin to multiple stamens of a flower, befitting the meaning of his name. One of his most notable features is the large scar running down the left side of Todo's face that he got from harsh training with Yuki.\n\nWhile Todo sports his jujutsu high uniform, he usually takes his jacket off and rips the undershirt before or during the battle. He usually dons martial arts pants and slippers. Todo's choice of pants is very loose and stops above the ankle with a bright blue sash wrapped around the waist. He wore a tennis-type of outfit while playing ping-pong with Mei Mei, sporting a collared shirt and shorts rather than his normal outfit.\n\nIn his fantasy of attending junior high with Yuji Itadori and Takada, Todo wears a school uniform that consists of a black jacket similar to his Jujutsu High one. Like with all his jackets, Todo left it open to reveal the undershirt. Even in these forged memories, Aoi wears his blue sash with his pants.\n\nDuring the Shibuya Incident, Todo had to sever his left hand to avoid being fully transfigured by Mahito, and severely damaged his right palm by slapping Mahito's hand briefly to swap with Yuji.\n\nDuring the Shinjuku Showdown Arc, Todo is shown to have lots of bandages wrapped around his left hand after his hand being fully transfigured by Mahito. Once the bandages were taken off, it was revealed he replaced his left hand with a vibraslap.[4]","image":"https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/jujutsu-kaisen-anime-season-2-episode-21-todo-takada.jpg","date":"2024-05-08"},{"id":"58ca60fa-b96b-41db-8e75-4d41330339ce","title":"Toji the best antagonist","description":"Toji Fushiguro (伏ふし黒ぐろ甚とう爾じ Fushiguro Tōji?), born Toji Zenin (禪ぜん院いん甚とう爾じ Zen'in Tōji?) is a recurring character in the Jujutsu Kaisen series. He was a former member of the Zenin clan and the infamous assassin known as the Sorcerer Killer (術じゅつ師し殺ごろし Jutsushi Goroshi?), contracted by the Time Vessel Association among other groups throughout his time as a non-curse user.

Toji is a tall, muscular man with mid-length straight black hair that reaches to his ears. His eyes are green, just like his son's, and he has thin black eyebrows and a scar on the corner of his right lip. For casual attire, Toji wears a simple outfit consisting of a long-sleeved shirt and matching pants with sandals. While fighting, Toji wears a tight-fitting black shirt, sports tan baggy training pants with a black belt weaved through the waist and black martial arts slippers. While still a member of the Zenin clan, Toji wore a dark colored haori over a black yukata. After being reanimated by Granny Ogami, Toji inhabits the body of her grandson.
